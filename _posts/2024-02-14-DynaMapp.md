### Our Venture into Dynamic Identification of Collaborative Robots
 
Hello, Dynamium! Today, we are thrilled to share with you an exciting news: our project has become a reality thanks to generous funding from NBIF, Université de Moncton, and ACOA. Yes, you heard it right, we've convinced real humans to finance our robot friends!

Our mission? To make collaborative robots smart enough to understand not only what they are doing but also what they are doing it with. In other words, we are teaching them to recognize the dynamic pattern of their load. It's like teaching a child not only to recognize that they are carrying a bag but also to understand if it contains books or candies (especially candies).

### Smarter Robots, Happier Humans
The ultimate goal is to create an environment where humans and robots can work together in harmony. Imagine: a robot handing you the right tool at the right moment without you even having to ask for it. It's a bit like having an assistant who reads your mind but without the awkward conversations around the coffee machine.

Of course, the path is filled with obstacles. It's not enough to tell a robot to "be smart." There are complicated algorithms, tons of tests, and yes, some moments where our robots behave a bit like stubborn children. But every little success brings us closer to our grand goal.

### Towards the Future and Beyond
We are excited to continue this adventure and share our progress with you. Stay tuned for updates, anecdotes, and probably some fun videos of our robots in action (or in "thought").

Thank you for reading! We look forward to building a future where robots are not just tools but partners.

### A Word of Thanks

We would like to express our infinite gratitude to NBIF, Université de Moncton, and ACOA. Without their support, our robots would probably still be trying to figure out the difference between a hammer and a screwdriver.

### Celebrating Research Excellence Abroad

This summer, our researcher **Limam Sedki** proudly represented the lab at the **IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM 2025)**, held at the **University of Portsmouth, United Kingdom**.  

He presented our collaborative paper titled *“Decoupled MPC with Constrained Optimization for Enhanced Robot Manipulator Trajectory Tracking,”* highlighting innovative control strategies designed to improve precision and robustness in robotic motion, work completed during his Master’s program at **Université de Moncton**.

### From Moncton to Portsmouth: A Journey of Innovation

Sedki’s presentation was featured in the session *Intelligent Mechatronics, Automation, Control Systems & Rehabilitation Robot System, Neuro-Robotics, Wearable Robots*, a perfect fit for the innovative spirit of Dynamium.  

This work explores a **decoupled model predictive control (MPC)** architecture that combines **constrained optimization** with real-time control. The result? Smoother, more efficient trajectories and enhanced stability for robot manipulators.

### Towards Smarter, More Capable Robots

Through projects like this, Dynamium continues to push the boundaries of intelligent control systems. Each paper, presentation, and prototype brings us closer to the goal of making robots not only stronger and faster, but also smarter and more adaptable.

### Acknowledgments and Support

This research was supported by funding from the **New Brunswick Innovation Foundation (NBIF)** and the **Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA – APECA)**.  

Congratulations, **Limam Sedki**, for this outstanding achievement and for representing Dynamium internationally with excellence!

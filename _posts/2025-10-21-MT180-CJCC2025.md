### A Spring of Research at Dynamium

Hello, Dynamium! This spring 2025, several members of our lab took the stage at two major events to present their cutting-edge work at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence. And guess what : **three of them came home with awards!**

Yes, our researchers don’t just control robots, they also manage to charm the juries (with solid science, of course).

### Three Awards, Three Inspiring Projects

- 🥇 **Ghali Kabbaj** won **First Prize – Undergraduate Category** at the *Colloque des jeunes chercheures et chercheurs* for his presentation: *“Improving the Accuracy of a Robotic Arm Model Using a Hybrid AI-Physics Approach.”*  
  In simple terms: teaching a robotic arm to better understand its own dynamics — like a robot discovering its muscles.

- 🥈 **Nikos Doiron** earned **Second Prize – Doctoral Category** at the *Ma thèse en 180 secondes (MT180)* competition for his project: *“A Human-Robot Collaboration Like That Between Two Humans.”*  
  The goal: making human-robot interaction as natural as talking to a colleague. Except this one never forgets what you asked for.

- 💖 **Meriem Haddaji Mastouri** won the **Audience Favorite Award** with her presentation: *“Fast Robotics: Harnessing GPU Power to Optimize Trajectories.”*  
  In other words, making robots move as fast as our GPUs heat up during a simulation.

### The Dynamium Spirit

These achievements highlight what makes Dynamium stand out: **curiosity, creativity, and scientific rigor.**  
Our researchers explore how to make robots smarter, faster, and more collaborative, always with a sense of humor, because a lab without laughter is like a robot without power.

Congratulations again to Meriem, Nikos, and Ghali for their excellent presentations and well-deserved awards!
